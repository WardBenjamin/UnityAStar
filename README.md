Unity A*
=========

A* pathfinding implementation implemented and optimized for tile-based games. It could be easily expanded in the future to perform well for 3D environments, but 
Unity already has a navigation mesh implemented to do so.

Possible improvements:

 - Add interfaces to make implementation simpler


Suggestions and contributions welcome!
